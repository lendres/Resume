			<p>Areas of worked included drilling dynamics, drilling optimization, and data analysis.</p>
			<bulletedlist>
				<item>
					Conducted an in-depth review of a proprietary drilling dynamics tool.  Review included available hardware sensors, calculations performed by the firmware, data file output, control algorithms, dynamic behavior, and operational usage.  The conclusions were documented and recomendations made on how to proceed with further testing and development of the device.
				</item>
				<item>
					Wrote FEA based software used to calculate deflections, stresses, and mode shapes of a drill string.
				</item>
				<item>
					Developed data processing techniques and algorithms.  Implemented as a software package used to automate cleaning and processing of drilling data.
				</item>
				<item>
					Developed generalized plotting software designed to work with data from any downhole tool.  Software is immune to changes in firmware, easily adaptable to new tools, and has error handling for corrupted data.
				</item>
				<!--<item>
					Provided recommendations on developing a path to full drilling automation.  Contributions included assessing available resources, assessing currently available technology, and determining what technology needs to be developed.
				</item>
				<item>
					Developed an architecture for all of the drilling optimization and automation software.
				</item>
				<item>
					Taught drilling dynamics and mechanics, object oriented design practices, and .Net Framework.
