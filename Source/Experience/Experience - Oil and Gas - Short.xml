			<p>Areas of work included developing engineering software, data analysis, and drilling dynamics.\nolinebreak[4]</p>
			<bulletedlist>
				<item>
					Developed an FEA based software used for structural analysis of drill strings.
				</item>
				<bulletedlist>
					<item>
						The software calculates deflections, stresses, natural frequencies, and mode shapes.
					</item>
					<item>
						The software is used to assess the bending capabilities and stress limits of drill strings and assess the consequences of design changes.
					</item>
				</bulletedlist>
				<item>
					Developed a software application used to automate the cleaning and processing of data.
				</item>
				<bulletedlist>
					<item>
						The software uses specialized data processing techniques and algorithms to automatically separate the data into drilling versus non-drilling time (up time versus down time).

			<p>
				Conducted research in the areas of drilling mechanics and dynamics.  Work included developing theoretical understandings of drilling behavior, designing laboratory experiments, and developing computer models to predict drilling behavior.
			</p>
			<bulletedlist>
				<item>
					Developed a proprietary computer model used to predict the dynamic behavior of drill bits.
					<bulletedlist>
						<item>
							Model uses a hybrid physics and data driven (grey box) approach to predict behavior.
						</item>
						<item>
							Responsibilities included the physics, software design and architecture, algorithms, project schedule, deliverables, and budget.
						</item>
						<item>
							Developed a technique to reduce the cost of model fitting by an order of magnitude.
						</item>
						<item>Led a Russia based software development team.</item>
					</bulletedlist>
				</item>
				<item>
					My research led to an improved theoretical understanding of lateral drill bit vibrations.
					I used this understanding to create new techniques for designing drill bits.
					<italic>This let engineers design bits directly rather than requiring hundreds of computer simulations that randomly searched for a solution.</italic>
				</item>
				<item>Developed a technique used to interpret laboratory data.  The technique is a physics-based approach that replaced the previous assumption-based method.</item>
				<!--<item>Designed and oversaw experiments in a laboratory setting and on a full-scale drill rig.</item>-->
