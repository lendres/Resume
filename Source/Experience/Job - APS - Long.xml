		<p>Areas of work included developing engineering software, data analysis, and drilling dynamics.\nolinebreak[4]</p>
		<bulletedlist>
			<item>
				Developed an FEA based software used for structural analysis of drill strings.
			</item>
			<bulletedlist>
				<item>
					The software calculates deflections, stresses, natural frequencies, and mode shapes.
				</item>
				<item>
					The software is used to assess the bending capabilities and stress limits of drill strings and assess the consequences of design changes.
				</item>
			</bulletedlist>
			<item>
				Developed a software application used to automate the cleaning and processing of data.
			</item>
			<bulletedlist>
				<item>
					The software uses specialized data processing techniques and algorithms to automatically separate the data into drilling versus non-drilling time (up time versus down time).
				</item>
			</bulletedlist>
			<item>
				Developed generalized plotting software which can be configured for any type of input data.
			</item>
			<bulletedlist>
				<item>
					The input data came from a wide variety of sources that each had their own data format (syntax, organization, content, units of measurements).  Software architecture
					was used to generalize the process and handle all the data sources in an organized way.
				</item>
				<item>
					The software is capable of handling corrupt data and conversion of units.
