					Developed a software application used to automate the cleaning and processing of data.
				</item>
				<bulletedlist>
					<item>
						The software uses specialized data processing techniques and algorithms to automatically separate time series data into categories based on the signal.
					</item>
				</bulletedlist>					
						

				<item>
					Developed generalized plotting software which can be configured for any type of input data.
				</item>
				<bulletedlist>
					<item>
						The input data came from a wide variety of sources that each had their own data format (syntax, organization, content, units of measurements).  Software architecture
						was used to generalize the process and handle all the data sources in an organized way.
					</item>
					<item>
						The software is capable of handling (cleaning) corrupt data and conversion of units.

			<p>
				Conducted research in the areas of drilling mechanics and dynamics.  Work included developing theoretical understandings of drilling behavior, designing laboratory experiments, and developing computer models to predict drilling behavior.
			</p>

				<item>
					Developed a proprietary computer model used to predict the dynamic behavior of drill bits.  The software models the physics of a drill bit removing rock material.
					<bulletedlist>
						<item>
							The physics model is fit to laboratory data using genetic algorithms or gradient descent.  
						</item>
						<item>
							I developed a technique to reduce the cost of solving by an order of magnitude.
						</item>
						<item>Led a Russia based software development team.</item>
						<item>
							Responsibilities included the physics, software design and architecture, algorithms, project schedule, deliverables, and budget.
						</item>
						<!--<item>
							The software is multi-threaded.  I created a technique to automatically avoid race conditions and deadlocks without requiring extensive use of mutexes.
						</item>-->
					</bulletedlist>
				</item>
				<item>Developed a data processing technique used to interpret laboratory data.  The technique is a physics-based approach that replaced the previous assumption-based method.</item>
