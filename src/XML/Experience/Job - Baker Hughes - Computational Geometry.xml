			<item>
				Developed a proprietary computer model used to predict the dynamic behavior of drill bits.  The software models the physics of a drill bit removing rock material.

					<item>
						The software uses a custom computational geometry engine written to ensure performance and accuracy.  It uses a discrete boundary surface and
						calculates swept volumes and surface intersections.  It continuously updates an evolving surface while mainting the mesh quality.
					</item>
					<item>
						Model uses a hybrid physics and data driven (grey box) approach to predict behavior.
					</item>
					<item>
						Responsibilities included the physics, software design and architecture, algorithms, project schedule, deliverables, and budget.
					</item>
					<item>Led an overseas based software development team that furthered my development work.</item>
					<item>
						Technologies used: C++, C, C#, .Net Framework, XML, XSLT, QT, multithreading, distributed computing, HPC, Matlab, HTML, Javascript
