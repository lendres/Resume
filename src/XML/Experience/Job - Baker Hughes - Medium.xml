		<p>
			Conducted research in drilling mechanics and dynamics.

			<item>
				Developed a computer model used to predict the dynamic behavior of drill bits.
				<bulletedlist>
					<item>
						Written in C++, the model uses a hybrid physics and data driven approach to predict behavior.  In this approach, the known physics are captured by physical models.  The unknown physics are modeled using machine learning techniques.
					</item>
					<item>
						Oversaw the physics models, software design and architecture, and project management, ensuring software accuracy, timely deliverables, and adherence to budget, resulting in efficient project execution.
					</item>
					<item>
						Developed a technique to reduce the cost of model fitting by an order of magnitude.
					</item>
					<item>Transferred development to an overseas-based software team and managed them.</item>

			<item>
				Conducted research that led to an improved theoretical understanding of lateral drill bit vibrations and which I used to develop novel techniques for
				designing drill bits. <italic>This let engineers design bits directly rather than randomly searching for a solution.</italic>
			</item>
			<item>Developed a technique used to interpret laboratory data.  The technique is a physics-based approach that replaced the previous assumption-based method.</item>
