			<item>
				Developed a proprietary computer model used to predict the dynamic behavior of drill bits.

					<item>
						Model uses a hybrid physics and data driven approach to predict behavior.  In this approach, the known physics are captured by physical models.  The unknown physics are modeled using machine learning techniques.
					</item>
					<item>
						Oversaw the physics models, software design and architecture, and project management, ensuring software accuracy, timely deliverables, and adherence to budget, resulting in efficient project execution.
					</item>
					<item>
						Developed a technique to reduce the cost of model fitting by an order of magnitude.
					</item>
					<item>Led an overseas based software development team.</item>

			<item>
				Conducted research that led to an improved theoretical understanding of lateral drill bit vibrations and I used this to create new techniques for
				designing drill bits. <italic>This let engineers design bits directly rather than randomly searching for a solution.</italic>
			</item>
			<item>Developed a technique used to interpret laboratory data.  The technique is a physics-based approach that replaced the previous assumption-based method.</item>
