		<p>
			Conducted research in the areas of drilling mechanics and dynamics.  Work included developing theoretical understandings of drilling behavior, designing laboratory experiments, and developing computer models to predict drilling behavior.

			<item>
				Developed a proprietary computer model used to predict the dynamic behavior of drill bits.
				<bulletedlist>
					<item>
						Model uses a hybrid physics and data driven (grey box) approach to predict behavior.
					</item>
					<item>
						Responsibilities included the physics, software design and architecture, algorithms, project schedule, deliverables, and budget.
					</item>
					<item>
						The software models the physics of a drill bit removing rock material.
					</item>
					<item>
						The software is multi-threaded.  I created a technique to automatically avoid race conditions and deadlocks without requiring extensive use of mutexes.
					</item>
					<item>
						The physics model is calibrated to laboratory data by solving the inverse problem.  I developed a technique to reduce the cost of solving by an order of magnitude.

					<item>Led an overseas based software development team.</item>

			<item>
				My research led to an improved theoretical understanding of lateral drill bit vibrations.  I used this understanding to create new techniques for 
				designing drill bits.  <italic>These techniques let engineers design bits directly rather than requiring hundreds of computer simulations that randomly searched for a solution.</italic>  This saved time and money.
			</item>
			<item>Developed a technique used to interpret laboratory data.  The technique is a physics-based approach that replaced the previous assumption-based method.</item>
			<!--<item>Designed and oversaw experiments in a laboratory setting and on a full-scale drill rig.</item>-->
