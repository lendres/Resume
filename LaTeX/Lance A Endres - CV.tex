            {Principal Engineer}
            {APS Technology}
			{Houston, TX}
			
					\noindent Areas of work included drilling dynamics, drilling optimization, and data analysis.
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
					Developed an FEA based software that calculates deflections, stresses, natural frequencies, and mode shapes of a drill string.  The software is used to assess the bending capabilities and stress limits of tools and drill strings, ensure natural frequencies are not excited, and assess the consequences of design changes.
					
		\item 
					Developed specialized data processing techniques and algorithms used to automate the cleaning and processing of drilling data.  The software removes corrupted data points and separates the data into drilling versus non-drilling time.  
		\textit{Reduced the process from an hour to a minute.}
	
		\item 
					Developed generalized plotting software designed to work with data from any downhole tool.  Software is immune to changes in firmware, easily adaptable to new tools, has error handling for corrupted data, and automatic conversion of units.  The industry lacks standards for data handling, so similar data is often stored differently, even within a company.  
		\textbf{Before I solved this issue, three others had tried and failed to find a solution.}

            \catentry{1/2006 - 11/2013}
            {Researcher in Drilling Mechanics and Dynamics}
            {Baker Hughes}
			{Houston, TX}
			
					\noindent 
				Conducted research in the areas of drilling mechanics and dynamics.  Work included developing theoretical understandings of drilling behavior, designing laboratory experiments, and developing computer models to predict drilling behavior.
			
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
					Developed an advanced, proprietary computer model used to predict and analyze the dynamic behavior of drill bits.  Was responsible for the physics, software design and architecture, algorithms, project schedule, deliverables, and budget.
					
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
							The software models the physics of a drill bit removing rock material.
						
		\item 
							The software is multi-threaded to speed up the simulation through parallelization.  I created a clever technique to automatically avoid race conditions and deadlocks without requiring extensive use of mutexes.
						
		\item 
							The physics model is calibrated to laboratory data by solving the inverse problem.  
		\textbf{I developed a technique to reduce the cost of solving by an order of magnitude.}
	
		\item Lead the Russia based software development team.
		\end{bulletedlist}
	
		\item Improved theoretical understanding of lateral drill bit vibrations.  Used this understanding to create new techniques for designing drill bits.  
		\textit{These techniques let engineers design bits directly rather than requiring hundreds of computer simulations that randomly searched for a solution.}
	
		\item Developed a technique used to interpret laboratory data.  The technique is a physics-based approach that replaced the previous assumption-based method.
		\item Designed and oversaw experiments in a laboratory setting and on a full-scale drill rig.
