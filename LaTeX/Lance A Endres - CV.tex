		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
					Identified the business opportunity and formulated the business plan.
				
		\item 
					Designed a desktop-sized pick-and-place machine.

            {Principal Engineer}
            {APS Technology}
			{Houston, TX}
			Areas of work included developing engineering software, data analysis, and drilling dynamics.\nolinebreak[4]
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
					Developed an FEA based software used for structural analysis of drill strings.
				
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
						The software calculates deflections, stresses, natural frequencies, and mode shapes.
					
		\item 
						The software is used to assess the bending capabilities and stress limits of drill strings and assess the consequences of design changes.
					
		\end{bulletedlist}
	
		\item 
					Developed a software application used to automate the cleaning and processing of data.
				
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
						The software uses specialized data processing techniques and algorithms to automatically separate the data into drilling versus non-drilling time (up time versus down time).
					
		\end{bulletedlist}
	
		\item 
					Developed generalized plotting software which can be configured for any type of input data.
				
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
						The input data came from a wide variety of sources that each had their own data format (syntax, organization, content, units of measurements).  Software architecture
						was used to generalize the process and handle all the data sources in an organized way.
					
		\item 
						The software is capable of handling corrupt data and conversion of units.

            \catentry{1/2006 - 11/2013}
            {Researcher in Drilling Mechanics and Dynamics}
            {Baker Hughes}
			{Houston, TX}
			
				Conducted research in the areas of drilling mechanics and dynamics.  Work included developing theoretical understandings of drilling behavior, designing laboratory experiments, and developing computer models to predict drilling behavior.
			
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
					Developed a proprietary computer model used to predict the dynamic behavior of drill bits.
					
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
							Responsibilities included the physics, software design and architecture, algorithms, project schedule, deliverables, and budget.
						
		\item 
							The software models the physics of a drill bit removing rock material.
						
		\item 
							The software is multi-threaded.  I created a technique to automatically avoid race conditions and deadlocks without requiring extensive use of mutexes.
						
		\item 
							The physics model is calibrated to laboratory data by solving the inverse problem.  I developed a technique to reduce the cost of solving by an order of magnitude.
						
		\item Led a Russia based software development team.
		\end{bulletedlist}
	
		\item My research led to an improved theoretical understanding of lateral drill bit vibrations.  I used this understanding to create new techniques for designing drill bits.  
		\textit{These techniques let engineers design bits directly rather than requiring hundreds of computer simulations that randomly searched for a solution.}
	
		\item Developed a technique used to interpret laboratory data.  The technique is a physics-based approach that replaced the previous assumption-based method.
