			{Houston, TX}
			Areas of work included data analysis, developing engineering software, and drilling dynamics.\nolinebreak[4]
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
					Developed a software application used to automate the cleaning and processing of data.
				
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
						The software uses specialized data processing techniques and algorithms to automatically separate time series data into categories based on the signal.
					
		\end{bulletedlist}
	
		\item 
					Developed generalized plotting software which can be configured for any type of input data.
				
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
						The input data came from a wide variety of sources that each had their own data format (syntax, organization, content, units of measurements).  Software architecture
						was used to generalize the process and handle all the data sources in an organized way.
					
		\item 
						The software is capable of handling (cleaning) corrupt data and conversion of units.

            {Researcher in Drilling Mechanics and Dynamics}
            {Baker Hughes}
			{Houston, TX}
			
				Conducted research in the areas of drilling mechanics and dynamics.  Work included developing theoretical understandings of drilling behavior, designing laboratory experiments, and developing computer models to predict drilling behavior.
			
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
					Developed a proprietary computer model used to predict the dynamic behavior of drill bits.  The software models the physics of a drill bit removing rock material.
					
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
							The physics model is fit to laboratory data using genetic algorithms or gradient descent.  
						
		\item 
							I developed a technique to reduce the cost of solving by an order of magnitude.
						
		\item Led a Russia based software development team.
		\item 
							Responsibilities included the physics, software design and architecture, algorithms, project schedule, deliverables, and budget.
						
		\end{bulletedlist}
	
		\item Developed a data processing technique used to interpret laboratory data.  The technique is a physics-based approach that replaced the previous assumption-based method.
