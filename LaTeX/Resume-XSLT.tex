					\noindent Areas of worked included drilling dynamics, drilling optimization, and data analysis.
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
					Conducted an in-depth review of a proprietary drilling dynamics tool.  Review included available hardware sensors, calculations performed by the firmware, data file output, control algorithms, dynamic behavior, and operational usage.  The conclusions were documented and recomendations made on how to proceed with further testing and development of the device.
				
		\item 
					Wrote FEA based software used to calculate deflections, stresses, and mode shapes of a drill string.
				
		\item 
					Developed data processing techniques and algorithms.  Implemented as a software package used to automate cleaning and processing of drilling data.
				
		\item 
					Developed generalized plotting software designed to work with data from any downhole tool.  Software is immune to changes in firmware, easily adaptable to new tools, and has error handling for corrupted data.

            {Baker Hughes}
			{Houston, TX}
			
					\vspace*{-6pt}
					\noindent 
				Conducted research in the areas of drilling mechanics and dynamics.  Work included developing theoretical understandings of drilling behavior, designing laboratory experiments, and developing computer models to predict drilling behavior.
			
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
					Developed an advanced, proprietary computational dynamics application used to predict and analyze the dynamic behavior of drill bits.  Was responsible for implementation and accuracy of physics, software design and architecture, algorithms, project schedule, deliverables, and budget.
				
		\item Served as team member on project with objective to advance understanding of torsional and lateral drilling dynamics through a series of computer, laboratory, and full scale drill rig experiments.
		\item Developed a laboratory analysis technique to improve understanding of lateral bit dynamics and more precisely define backward whirl.
		\item Developed new techniques for designing drill bits to prevent lateral vibrations both in the new and worn states.
		\item Designed and oversaw running of experiments in laboratory setting and on a full scale drill rig.
		\item Analyzed and interpreted computer, laboratory, and drill rig data.
		\item Developed software to post process a variety of disjointed laboratory and computer data types in a standardized, uniform way.
		\item Lead a software development team based in Russia.
