            {Principal Engineer}
            {APS Technology}
			{Houston, TX}
			
					\vspace*{-6pt}
					\noindent Worked in the area of drilling dynamics, drilling optimization, and data processing and analysis.
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
					Conducted an in-depth review of a proprietary drilling dynamics tool.  Review included available hardware sensors, calculations performed by the firmware, data file output, control algorithms, dynamic behavior, and operational usage.  The conclusions were documented in a report which detailed the current status, where improvements could be made, and how to proceed with further testing and development of the device.
				
		\item 
					Developed data processing techniques and algorithms.  Implemented as a software package used to automate cleaning and processing of drilling data.
				
		\item 
					Worked on BHA analysis software to fix software issues and assess and repair sciencetific issues.
				
		\item 
					Developed generalized plotting software designed to work with data from any downhole tool.  Software needed to be immune to changes in firmware, easily adapt to new tool output, and have error handling for corrupted data.  Consisted of a data translation and validation library (custom written) combined with INT's WellLog plotting library.
				
		\item 
					Provided recommendations on developing a path to full drilling automation.  Contributions included assessing available resources, assessing currently available technology, and determining what technology needs to be developed.
				
		\item 
					Developed an architecture for all of the drilling optimization and automation software.
				
		\item 
					Taught drilling dynamics and mechanics, object oriented design practices, and .Net Framework.

            {Researcher in Drilling Mechanics and Dynamics}
            {Baker Hughes}
			{Houston, TX}
			
					\vspace*{-6pt}
					\noindent 
				Conducted research in the areas of drilling mechanics and dynamics.  Work included developing theoretical understandings of drilling behavior, designing laboratory experiments, and developing computer models to predict drilling behavior.
			
		\begin{bulletedlist}
			
		\item 
					Developed an advanced, proprietary computational dynamics application used to predict and analyze the dynamic behavior of drill bits, forces acting on cutters, cutting/bottom hole patterns, and AKO kinematics.  Was responsible for software design and architecture, algorithms, implementation and accuracy of physics, project schedule, deliverables, and budget.  Lead a team based in Russia to continue the development of the software.
		\item Served as team member on project with objective to advance understanding of torsional and lateral drilling dynamics through a series of computer, laboratory, and full scale drill rig experiments.
		\item Developed a laboratory analysis technique to improve understanding of lateral bit dynamics and more precisely define backward whirl.
		\item Developed new techniques for designing drill bits to prevent lateral vibrations both in the new and worn states.
		\item Designed and oversaw running of experiments in laboratory setting and on a full scale drill rig.
		\item Analyzed and interpreted computer, laboratory, and drill rig data.
		\item Developed software to post process a variety of disjointed laboratory and computer data types in a standardized, uniform way.
		\item Trained new employees and directed the work of interns.
		\item Served as a member of a cross-divisional numerical modeling and simulation committee.
